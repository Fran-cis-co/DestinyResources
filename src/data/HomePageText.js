  "I developed this website to provide multiple resources for the videogame Destiny 2 all under one website. These resources are things such as raid/dungeon encounter maps, useful third party websites, and more. I am sure many other websites such as these exist however, I wanted to make this to practice developing websites along for having passion for the videogame. All images/tools I provide on this website will have credit to its original poster. If there is a mistake on the crediting, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn with the provided link in the footer to let me know. If you are the original poster of the resource and wish for me to take it down, please contact me as well.";
